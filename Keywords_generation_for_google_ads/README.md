Case:   
Who we are?  - 
	A digital marketing agency
Who is the client/customer?
    A massive online retailer of furniture

What are we doing?

    Generating keywords for the following products:
    •	sofas
    •	convertible sofas
    •	love seats
    •	recliners
    •	sofa beds

Task specifications:
    •	The client is a low-cost retailer, offering many promotions and discounts. 
    •	We are targeting price-sensitive customers, so we focus on such keywords and move away from luxury keywords and topics
    •	We are tight on budget, so we focus on a tightly targeted set of keywords and make sure they are all set to exact and phrase match.
Implementation:
    •	We generate a list of words, that together with the products given above would make for good keywords. 
    •	For example:
        o	Products: sofas, recliners
        o	Words: buy, prices
        The resulting keywords: 
            'buy sofas', 'sofas buy', 'buy recliners', 'recliners buy', 'prices sofas', 'sofas prices', 'prices recliners', 'recliners prices'
