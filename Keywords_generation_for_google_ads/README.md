# Generating keywords for Google Ads


Case:   
Who we are?  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A digital marketing agency <br>
Who is the client/customer? <br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A massive online retailer of furniture <br>
What does client want to do?  <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Create large campaigns for all of their website <br>
What are we doing?  <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section.  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Generating keywords for the following products: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    •	sofas <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    •	convertible sofas <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    •	love seats <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    •	recliners <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    •	sofa beds <br> 

Task specifications: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    •	The client is a low-cost retailer, offering many promotions and discounts.  <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    •	We are targeting price-sensitive customers, so we focus on such keywords and move away from luxury keywords and topics <br> 
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   •	We are tight on budget, so we focus on a tightly targeted set of keywords and make sure they are all set to exact and phrase match. <br> 
Implementation: <br> 
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	We generate a list of words, that together with the products given above would make for good keywords.  <br> 
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	For example: <br> 
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Input - Products: sofas, recliners <br> 
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Words: buy, prices <br> 
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The resulting keywords:  <br> 
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      'buy sofas', 'sofas buy', 'buy recliners', 'recliners buy', 'prices sofas', 'sofas prices', 'prices recliners', 'recliners prices' <br>
